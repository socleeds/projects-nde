## Problem Domain

The University of Leeds alumni database contains over 245,000 ‘active records’
of Leeds graduates (alumni) and other supporters of the university. Each
constituent record contains data ranging from basic contact details, through
to donation details, business details, career history, interests and scale of
interaction with the university since graduation.

Some use cases for this database are relatively straightforward. For example,
if the School of Mechanical Engineering wanted to invite the class of 1992
to a 25-year reunion, it is easy to identify graduates of that school, in
that year.

However, there are other use cases that are not well supported by the current
technology. For example, imagine that the International Office requests the
details of those Leeds graduates who are ‘influential in industry’, because
senior university representatives will be visiting China, Japan and Malaysia
and are looking to set up meetings with these people. How do you go about
identifying these individuals in amongst 245,000 names? There is no
‘influential’ label on records in the existing database, and even if there
was, it would be too broad and would not help with drawing up a definitive
list of those who are influential in a specific area.

## Proposed Solution

In this project, the student(s) would work closely with members of the
Alumni & Development Team to develop one or more software prototypes. These
prototypes would demonstrate how the existing database can be combined with
additional information sources to derive measures of influence in an
automated or semi-automated fashion.

One approach might be to develop tools that can analyze the social media
footprint of alumni and compute some sort of influence rating.  News sources
such as the BBC might be another useful data source, provided that alumni
can be unambiguously identified so as to avoid false positives.

Research by the Alumni & Development team has identified the determination of
influence as a UK sector-wide issue, so a solution to this problem would be
regarded as ground-breaking.
