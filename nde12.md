Android now offers [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/), a
framework for using machine learning in mobile apps, with machine learning
models running either in the cloud or on the device.  Apple provide their
own on-device solution: [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml).

There is scope here for multiple projects in which students develop apps
that explore the capabilities of these different toolkits.  The problem solved
by the app can be one of the student's own choosing.
