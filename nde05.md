## Problem Domain

The [pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home) library provides
an object-oriented interface for developing games and other visually-rich
applications in Python on Linux, macOS and Windows systems.  It makes use of
the underlying support for OpenGL offered by those platforms and therefore
has few dependencies, making it relatively easy to install.

There is a reasonably useful programming guide available for pyglet, but
relatively few examples that will help its users understand how to get the
most out of it.  Also, it may not be ideal for users who are very new to
Python or to programming in general.

## Proposed Solution

One project could use the pyglet library to develop a software framework
that simplifies the development of games and graphics application, with the
aim of increasing the motivation and enjoyment of newcomers to programming.
The target audience here could be school or university students, as desired.

An alternative project would be more exploratory in nature, investigating
the current state of the library and its suitability for developing simple
games and graphics applications.  This project could even make contributions
to pyglet and write documentation that makes it easier to use for
inexperienced programmers.
