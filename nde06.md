## Problem Domain

LIDAR is a laser ranging technology that can be used to create accurate
topographic maps.  In 2015, DEFRA made their LIDAR dataset, covering
72% of England, [freely available as open data](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/21/defras-opening-up-its-data/).

## Proposed Solution

This project would involve investigation of the DEFRA dataset and
development of open source tools to manage, manipulate and visualise the
data.  These tools could be in the form of software libraries or
command line tools.  GUIs or web interfaces could also be developed,
depending on the interests and aptitude of the student.

The project could also include a 'field test', demonstrating how these
tools are used to solve a real-world problem.
