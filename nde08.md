## Problem Domain

Many modern computer systems have mobile apps as a component, but using
mobile apps as a front-end can be challenging for developers, given that
there are multiple platforms - Android and iOS, at minimum - that must be
supported.

One solution to managing this complexity is to move storage and business logic
into services running in the cloud, turning the apps themselves into
'thin clients' and thus minimising the size (and therefore management cost)
of the different app codebases.  Another possibility is to have a single app
codebase that uses cross-platform technology.  Examples of such technologies
include [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), Microsoft's C#-based
[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) and Google's new
[Flutter](https://flutter.io) SDK.

## Proposed Solution

This project would perform a critical evaluation of several different
cross-platform technologies, including (but not necessarily limited to)
those mentioned above.  Depending on the interests and aptitude of the
student, this could be a broad-ranging and largely empirical investigation,
involving small app experiments, or it could be a narrower and much more
in-depth exploration, involving the development and comparison of
sophisticated software prototypes.
