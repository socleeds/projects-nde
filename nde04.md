## Problem Domain

[ODI Leeds](http://odileeds.org) is one of the most active nodes in a
global network centred on the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org).
The Leeds node has been very successful in bringing together experts from
various domains in order to explore creative solutions to problems affecting
the region and its inhabitants.  These solutions invariably involve the use
of open data sources, such as those provided via
[Data Mill North](https://datamillnorth.org)
or [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk).

## Proposed Solution

This is not a proposal for a specific project; rather, it is a placeholder
for a range of possible projects, details to be decided, all involving
open data and close collaboration with ODI Leeds.

Please speak to Nick for further information, or see the ODI Leeds web site
for examples of what they have been up to recently.
