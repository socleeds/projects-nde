## Problem Domain

Object-oriented programming lends itself well to simulations; indeed,
simulation was the motivator for the creation of the very first OO language,
Simula.  So perhaps there would be value in teaching OO principles to
students via some form of simulation - particularly one that is interesting
visually.

Simulations offer some advantages over other approaches thought to be
particularly motivating for students,
[such as physical computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7044153/).
For example, using physical robots to teach programming may work well with
small classes, but won't scale to very large classes.  But teaching with
*simulated* robots, via frameworks such as
[Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/), will scale.

[Games and contests have been found to be useful in increasing learner
motivation and engagement](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/v10_2016_39_60.pdf),
so there is value in exploring at how this can be introduced into the teaching
of object-oriented programming in the first year of degree programmes at Leeds.

## Possible Projects

* Develop exercises and contests based around Robocode that can be
  integrated into level 1 teaching of OOP

* Explore the use of other simulation domains - e.g., agent-based simulations
  or artificial life; develop a software framework that students can use,
  along with exercises or worksheets that can be used in OOP teaching

* Explore how the [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Java game
  development framework could be used to teach OOP concepts, and development
  prototype exercises that demonstrate this

* Develop a prototype of a system similar to Microsoft's
  [Code Hunt](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/code-hunt/)
  coding challenges platform, but Java-based
