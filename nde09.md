## Problem Domain

Object-oriented programming lends itself well to simulations; indeed,
simulation was the motivator for the creation of the very first OO language,
Simula.  So perhaps there would be value in teaching OO principles to
students via some form of simulation - particularly one that is interesting
visually.

Simulations offer some advantages over other approaches thought to be
particularly motivating for students,
[such as physical computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7044153/).
For example, using physical robots to teach programming may work well with
small classes, but won't scale to very large classes.  But teaching with
*simulated* robots, via frameworks such as
[Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/), will scale.

## Proposed Solution

This project would explore how simulations could form the basis for teaching
object-oriented programming principles to students in COMP1721, developing
software prototypes to demonstrate the approach.

The aforementioned Robocode is a useful baseline here, but note that the
simulation domain need not be robotics; agent-based or artificial life
simulations might be equally productive for the purposes of this project.
Note also that the desired solution should be able to demonstrate a broad
range of concepts: class relationships such as association and
aggregation/composition, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, inner
classes, etc.

This could be a Exploratory Software project or a Software Product.  Some
preliminary investigation will be needed to decide which of these is the most
appropriate.
