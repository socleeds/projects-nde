Android's [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) and
[ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) in iOS have made it possible
to develop a range of different augmented reality applications for modern
smartphones.  Google's [Mobile Vision](https://developers.google.com/vision/)
(API) has likewise simplified tasks such as face detection and text recognition
for mobile app developers.

There is scope here for multiple projects in which students develop apps
that explore the capabilities of these different toolkits.  The problem solved
by the app can be one of the student's own choosing.
