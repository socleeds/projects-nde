# Final-Year Project Ideas

Ideas for undergraduate final-year projects with me in the School of Computing.

Click on a filename (``nde01.md``, etc) for details of a specific project.

Note that some ideas will be unavailable, having been done successfully as
projects in an earlier session.  Minerva is used to notify students of which
ideas are available as projects in a given session.
