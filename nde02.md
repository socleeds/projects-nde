## Problem Domain

An understanding of how to defend computer systems against attacks is
arguably best gained by studying, and participating in, realistic examples
of those attacks.  Clearly, this must be done in an ethical manner, with the
full permission of those who run the systems.  Equally clearly, it cannot be
done on 'production systems' that are being used for real work.

One approach to this is to run demonstrations in virtual machines.  An
example of this approach is the IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative's
[Try-CybSI](http://try.cybersecurity.ieee.org/trycybsi/) programme, which
provides a selection of demos.  However, these give only patchy coverage of
the range of attacks that are possible, and the demos themselves seem to
be rather unreliable and slow to run.

## Proposed Solution

There is scope for one or more projects looking at how VMs, container
technology and cloud providers might be used to provide a robust suite of
ethical hacking exercises.

An exploratory project is possible, in which the student researches the
different technology options and produces software prototypes to evaluate
them.

Another option is producing a software product.  In this project, the
student would focus on specific tools and use them to produce a robust
solution that can be used for real teaching.  Ideally, its suitability for
this purpose would be evaluated using other students who have taken
COMP3911.
