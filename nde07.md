## Problem Domain

'IoT' vies with 'blockchain' as the biggest technology buzzword of the past few
years.  All manner of unexpected devices now boast Internet connectivity
as a feature, despite [the sometimes questionable value that this brings to
the user](http://sfist.com/2017/09/26/you_can_only_wash_google_and_levis.php).

This brave new world brings with it new threats, as Brian Krebs discovered
when his blog suffered [an unprecedented DDoS by a million-strong botnet
of routers, cameras, PVRs and other devices](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/).

Is IoT the next frontier of innovation, or a catastrophe waiting to happen?

## Proposed Solution

This project would conduct research into the scale of the security problem
posed by the current generation of IoT devices, ideally producing some
sort of quantitative measure through analysis of vulnerability databases.

The project could explore the question of whether IoT devices are genuinely
less secure than more conventional hardware and software, or whether this
is merely a perception.  It could investigate the different types of
vulnerability found in IoT devices, seeking to understand which types are
more prevalent than others, and why this might be so.  Finally, it could look
for examples of best practice and make some recommendations that can be
followed by manufacturers of the next generation of devices.
